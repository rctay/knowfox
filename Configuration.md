Some aspects of Knowfox use configurable options. Among these are 

* the list of available concept types
* forward and backward titles of relationships  

Configuration is merged from three places:

* The file config/knowfox.php
* Packages, e.g. the package `knowfox/entangle`
* the `data` field of a user-specific top-level concept titled `Configuration`. This field is formated as a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) object.

If you want to seed your relationships with some entries, here is my list:

````

  commission: [ 'commissions', 'commissioned by' ]
